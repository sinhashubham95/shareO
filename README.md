### Steps to Run (MacOS)
1. Install Node **version>=8.11.4**. To install Node, use the following command - ```brew install node```. If you already have Node installed, you can check the version by typing the following command ```node -v```. If the **version<8.11.4**, the first install the Node Version Manager using the command ```brew install nvm```. Then you can keep any number of versions of Node in parallel and keep switching between them, that's how great it is. To install the Node LTS **version 10**, use ```nvm install 10``` and then switch to this version using ```nvm use 10```. That's it.
